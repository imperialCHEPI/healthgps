# User Guide
The *Health-GPS* microsimulation is a data driven modelling framework, combining many disconnected data sources to support the various interacting modules during a typical simulation experiment run. The framework provides a pre-populated backend data storage to minimise the learning curve for simple use cases, however advance users are likely to need a more in-depth knowledge of the full workflows. A high-level representation of the *Health-GPS workflow* is shown below, it is crucial that users have a good appreciation for the general dataflow and processes to better design experiments and quantify the results.

As with any simulation model, it is the user's responsibility to process and analyse input data, define the modelâ€™s hierarchy, and fit parameters to data. A configuration file (JSON) is used control the simulation running settings and map the *Health-GPS* expected parameters to the user input data and fitted values. Likewise, it is the user's responsibility to and analyse and quantify the model results, which are saved to a chosen output folder in `JSON` format.
