Global Health Policy Simulation model (Health-GPS)

Health-GPS microsimulation is part of the [STOP project](https://www.stopchildobesity.eu/), and support researchers and policy makers in the analysis of the health and economic impacts of alternative measures to tackle *chronic diseases* and *obesity in children*. The model reproduces the characteristics of a population and simulates key individual event histories associated with key components of relevant behaviours, such as physical activity, and diseases such as diabetes or cancer.

Childhood obesity is one of the major public health challenges throughout the world and is rising at an alarming rate in most countries. In particular, the rates of increase in obesity prevalence in developing countries have been more than 30% higher than those in developed countries. Simulation models are especially useful for assessing the long-term impacts of the wide range of policies that will be needed to tackle the obesity epidemic.
